🧪 Test Plan Document
Project: E-Commerce Web Application - Manual Testing
1. Introduction
This Test Plan document describes the testing strategy, scope, resources, schedule, and deliverables for manual testing of an E-Commerce web application.
The purpose of this plan is to ensure that the application meets functional requirements and is ready for release with acceptable quality.

2. Objective
The main objectives of testing are:
To verify that all functionalities work as per requirements
To identify defects before production releas
To ensure system stability and usabilit
To improve overall product quality

3. Application Under Test (AUT)
Application Type: E-Commerce Web Application

Key Modules:
User Registration
Login / Logout
Product Search
Add to Cart
Checkout
Payment

4. Scope of Testing

4.1 In-Scope
Functional testing of all major modules
UI validation
Smoke testing
Regression testing
System testing

4.2 Out-of-Scope
Performance testing
Security testing
Compatibility testing on multiple devices
Automation testing

5. Test Approach
Testing will be performed manually
Test scenarios and test cases will be created based on requirements
Test execution results will be documented in Excel
Defects will be logged and tracked using a defect report
Regression testing will be performed after defect fixes

6. Types of Testing
Functional Testing
Smoke Testing
Regression Testing
System Testing
